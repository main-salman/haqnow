When corrupt officials, defense contractors, and political elites operate without accountability, the result is often devastating: unnecessary wars, human rights abuses, and the systematic exploitation of vulnerable populations. By creating a secure, anonymous platform for whistleblowers and truth-tellers, HaqNow aims to shine light on these dark practices.",
    "missionDesc3": "Our work is rooted in the understanding that transparency is not just a democratic ideal—it's a tool for peace and justice.

To maintain integrity, legality, and safety, HaqNow uses a structured moderation process designed to ensure that all published materials are legally obtained, legally publishable, and aligned with its mission.\n\nThe following best practices guide how the HaqNow moderation team reviews, approves, and manages submitted documents.\n\nCore principles:\n\n• Legally obtained only: HaqNow will publish only documents that appear to be legally obtained and legal to publish.\n• Protect individuals, not target them: HaqNow exists to hold institutions accountable — not private individuals.\n• Privacy-first: HaqNow does not collect identifying information from uploaders and follows strict privacy regulations.\n• Compliance-oriented: HaqNow prioritizes compliance with international laws to avoid legal disputes.\n• Safety over sensationalism: Documents that risk harm, doxxing, or exposure of private individuals will not be published.",
